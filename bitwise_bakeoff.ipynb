        "Now that we have a dataset, we explored genetic algorithms and how they work. Seems pretty straight forward, However, most examples tend to become really technicle and focus on solving problems in a binary manner. We decided to try a method where we embrace this binary manner and try to encode each ingridient of a recipe as a bit string, giving values to each ingridient on random. The way evaluation, mutation, and crossover will work are:\n",
        "### Evaluation\n",
        "The fitness of the recipe is evaluated on the length of its ingridients. More then length, higher the fitness. We decided for a 40% exploitation i.e 40% of the selected population based on fitness alone, and 60% exploration i.e adding random samples to the selected population. This could have been improved by looking at the sweetness of the ingridients and the amount of sugar in the recipe, but we decided to keep it simple for now. Also, another way to evaluate recipes could be done the opposite way, where we look at the length of the ingridients and the amount of sugar in the recipe and select the shortest recipe with the highest amount of sugar. We decided to go with the first method as it is more intuitive and easier to understand.\n",
